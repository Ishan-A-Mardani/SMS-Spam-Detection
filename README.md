# SMS-Spam-Detection

*	This project classifies SMS as spam or ham. I first removed non-alphanumeric characters and stop words (including punctuations). 
*	Then I used 3 different ML techniques. Firstly, I transformed word to vectors using Word2Vec of gensim. Then I Did Lemmatization followed by Tokenization. I utilized various ML Algorithms such as Multi-Layer Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and various others. 
*	Second, I used TF-IDF technique for vectorization followed by various ML Algorithms.
*	Third, I build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM to process the SMS text and classify it.
*	Tech Stack used: Python, NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit), gensim, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (Keras)
